Automatically rotates the screen of a tablet laptop based on orientation using the HDAPS sensor. It was developed for the ThinkPad X61 Tablet, but it should work with any other tablet too.

There is also a script called manual-rotate.py that allows you to disable automatic rotation. It basically allows you to manually change rotation until full circle is reached. The automatic rotation is enabled again.
manual-rotate.py can also be used as a stand-alone script, without auto-rotate.py running. In that case, it just rotates the screen 90 degrees.

It functions as follows:
- Connects to a running auto-rotate.py script via dbus, and continue does the following if laptop is in tablet mode
  - Disables autorotation, and rotates the screen 90 degrees
  - If rotation is already disabled, and we've reached 180 degree rotation (upside down screen, when in laptop mode), then autorotation is enabled again.
- If cannot connect to dbus (auto-rotate.py not running), then it rotates the screen 90 degrees.

Requirements:
 - python-xrandr
 - python-dbus
 - python-glib

To install:
   1) Run ./setup.py install with write permissions.
   2) Add auto-rotate.py to automatic startup script.
      a) For example, add the following to the end, but before exit 0, of /etc/gdm/Init/Default
         auto-rotate.py &
   3) Bind a button to manual-rotate.py command, which disables automatic rotation and allows you to control it manually.
